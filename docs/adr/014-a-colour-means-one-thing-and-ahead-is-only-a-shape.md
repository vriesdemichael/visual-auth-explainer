# ADR-014: A colour means one thing, and what is ahead is only a shape

Colours come from the tokens in `src/app.css`, and each means one thing everywhere: how a message travels, what it carries, where you are, or who has no business here. There are few of them, because one thing should stand out at a time, and the test holds the list. What it carries is three quiet groups, what proves something, what gets something and what remembers, because the chip already says which it is. What a setting just changed is a soft band that goes again, with no hue of its own. Text meets WCAG AA on what it sits on, in both themes, and `src/theme.test.ts` holds it to that. A new pair of text and background goes in that test. What each thing that gets passed around looks like is there too, one rule for each, so a new one touches no component. Two forms of one thing, such as a verifier and its challenge, share a colour.

Only the current step stands out: its arrow is heavier and its number is filled in. What has happened stays readable and quiet.

Motion is for what changed, and nothing else moves. Next and Execute send a message, so one small marker travels its arrow in 350 ms, and its words, its chips and what it adds under a lifeline show when it gets there. The marker is hollow when nothing in it is a token or a secret, as with a refusal, and then nothing lands. Back and a jump show a step without moving anything. A setting moves the diagram in stages that keep anything from crossing anything: what leaves goes, the rows move with new arrows and lifelines coming into the room they make, and then new words and chips arrive. Words that change go with what leaves and come with what arrives. With reduced motion nothing moves, and all of it is simply there.

Seen as one party, what it never saw is a muted bar as wide as the words were, with the arrow nearly gone, and the words themselves are not on the page. A bar has no hue of its own, because it says only that something was there.

Pointing at a setting or focusing it shows what it would do, with nothing about the state changed. What it would add is a ghost, lighter than what is there, with words where what is ahead has none, and what it would take away is struck through. Neither has a hue of its own. Steps being one ordered list means both states fit on one diagram with no working out, and rows move only as far as that needs.

Following one thing lights up its path and quiets the rest, with no hue of its own either. Its path ahead is spelled out, because someone asked for exactly that, like a setting's change and a preview, the only other places where what is ahead gets words.

A step shows what has happened and no more. Every message has a number. Up to the current step it has a label and its chips. Ahead it is a faint arrow with its number, and its label appears on pointing at it or when a setting has just changed it. So text is either readable or absent, never faded. That faint arrow is below the 3:1 WCAG 1.4.11 asks of what someone needs, on purpose: it is a preview and not a thing to read, its number is AA, and a stronger one would compete with the current step, which the maintainer has asked to stand out alone.

A message says how it travels: through the browser, direct, or between people. Credentials and tokens are chips on the message, on the line of its label, and that label wraps rather than overrun its arrow. A test holds that in every combination. Under each lifeline are chips for what it has seen so far, which `holdingsAt` works out from the fields on the steps and is never written by hand, so it cannot disagree with the flow. The heads keep room for the most they will hold at any step, so stepping never moves a row.

Limited context per step is the quality the maintainer asked to keep, and the numbers let someone presenting say which step they mean. What crosses the browser and what does not is the security idea of a redirect flow, and who has seen what is the question behind "why a code and then a token". Both were only in the text before, and a colour that meant two things would teach nothing.

## Not chosen

- **Draw only the messages so far, as IdentiFlows does**: A setting that changes something ahead would change nothing on screen, and that change is what this application exists to show.
- **A refusal that stops short of the lifeline**: It would draw a 400 as not arriving, and it does arrive. What it does is leave nothing behind, which the hollow marker and the unchanged chips show.
- **A marker on every step, in either direction**: Something moving on Back says a message is being sent when nothing is.
- **Faded labels for what is ahead**: They fail contrast, and they are noise at the step someone is trying to read.
- **A picture of what each lifeline has seen, written per step**: It would drift from the flow, and adding a setting would mean rewriting it.
