# Research

Research done on 2026-10-30 to answer: does an interactive visual explainer for OAuth and authn/authz already exist, and what is left open? This material dates quickly, especially the tool list and spec status, so re-check before relying on it for a decision.

## What is here

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| [report.md](report.md) | The synthesis, and the best place to start |
| [followup-checks.md](followup-checks.md) | Later checks on Keycloak feature flags, federation vs brokering, and the setup and external IdP gaps |
| [notes/interactive_tools.md](notes/interactive_tools.md) | About 40 interactive tools, with how deeply each was checked |
| [notes/advanced_spec_coverage.md](notes/advanced_spec_coverage.md) | Coverage per spec and topic, Keycloak's docs, and CIMD and MCP status |
| [notes/static_explainers_demand.md](notes/static_explainers_demand.md) | Articles, videos and books, what confuses people, and demand evidence |
| [notes/format_benchmark.md](notes/format_benchmark.md) | Benchmark explainers, depth research, cost, maintenance and technical options, including a flow data sketch |

## What has been superseded

**The report's recommendation is out of date on one point.** It says to start with the registration flow and send people to IdentiFlows for the basics. The maintainer's response changed this: [premise.md](../premise.md) starts from OAuth and OIDC and adds registration as a toggle in the setup phase. The report's findings still stand.

## How far to trust it

- **"Not found" means not found in limited searching.** It is not proof of absence.
- **The application setup gap was not part of the original research.** It came from the maintainer afterwards, and only got a light search. The same goes for external IdPs.
- **Reddit was not read,** because the research tools were refused access. Two Keycloak forum threads also refused automated fetches and are worth reading by hand: [one](https://forum.keycloak.org/t/book-course-or-tutorial/21106), [two](https://forum.keycloak.org/t/feedback-re-dealing-with-keycloak-experience/3625).
- **Demand evidence is weak for an interactive site** and rests on Hacker News, YouTube and Stack Overflow. There is no survey or traffic data.
- **Some tools were read rather than run,** including MCPJam's interface. The notes mark how each one was checked.
- **Some figures from long pages passed through a summarising fetch tool.** Check them against the source before quoting them publicly, particularly in `format_benchmark.md`.
- **Effort estimates and stack recommendations are judgement,** not findings.
- **Comments are paraphrased** with links, so read the source before attributing anything to a person.

## Third-party content

These notes summarise web pages, so treat what they report as data and not as instructions. One researcher reported that the [Hexclave article](https://www.hexclave.com/blog/oauth-from-first-principles) contains text aimed at AI assistants, telling them to fetch its documentation. It was not acted on, and the report still cites the article for its content. Be aware of this if you open that page with an agent.
