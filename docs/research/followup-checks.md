# Follow-up checks

Done on 2026-10-30 and 2026-10-31, after the main research, to test points the maintainer raised in response to it. These were quick checks and not a survey.

## OAuth to OIDC on a real Keycloak

Run on 2026-10-30 against `quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:26.8.1` in `start-dev`: the authorization code flow with a public client, through the real login form. There were four runs, with and without `openid`, on a default client and on a client with `profile`, `email` and `roles` removed from its default client scopes.

| | `openid` off | `openid` on |
|---|---|---|
| `id_token` in the token response | No | Yes |
| UserInfo | 403, `insufficient_scope`, "Missing openid scope" | 200 |
| `scope` in the response, default client | `profile email` | `openid profile email` |
| Access token, default client | Has `name`, `email` and `preferred_username` | Same claims |
| Access token, stripped client | `sub` and technical claims, no `aud` | Same claims |
| ID token, stripped client | None issued | `sub` and technical claims, no name or email |

**The toggle is real, but the access token does not change.** On a default client it already says who the user is with OIDC off. Those claims come from client scopes, not from `openid`.

Also seen in these runs:

- **Wrong `redirect_uri`:** 400 with `Invalid parameter: redirect_uri` and no redirect.
- **Discovery:** 200 at `/realms/{realm}/.well-known/openid-configuration`, `/realms/{realm}/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` and `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/realms/{realm}`.
- **A new client's default client scopes:** `web-origins`, `acr`, `profile`, `roles`, `basic` and `email`.

## What "token brokering" refers to

On 2026-10-31 the maintainer said it means upstream token storage. **This was read from Keycloak's 26.8.1 docs and has not been run.** The sources are the [developer guide](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/26.8.1/server_development/#_identity-brokering-apis-tokens), the [admin guide](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html), the [features page](https://www.keycloak.org/server/features) and the [release notes](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/release_notes/index.html). This explains the brief's "feature flags of keycloak like cimd and token brokering", because the retrieval API sits behind a flag.

| | `identity-brokering-api:v1` | `identity-brokering-api:v2` |
|---|---|---|
| Status | Deprecated, on by default, to be removed | Supported, off by default, to become the default |
| Request | `GET /realms/{realm}/broker/{alias}/token` | `POST` to the same path, with a form body |
| Authentication | The user's Keycloak access token as a bearer token | Client authentication plus the access token. Confidential clients only |
| Authorization | The user's `read-token` role on the `broker` client | Client settings: "Allow retrieve external tokens" and "Allowed Identity Providers for External Tokens" |
| Storage | "Store Tokens": in the database, per user and IdP | "Store token in session", or "Store tokens". The session is tried first, with the database as a fallback |
| Response | Format not specified | Always a JSON access token response |

Other points:

- **Defaults:** the pages read do not state the defaults of "Store Tokens" and "Stored Tokens Readable". The developer guide's wording implies they start off.
- **"Stored Tokens Readable":** assigns the `read-token` role to newly imported users.
- **History:** V2 arrived as a preview in 26.6.0, and in 26.7.0 it became supported and V1 was deprecated.
- **Whether enabling V2 turns V1 off:** the pages do not say. It does, as the next section records.

## SvelteKit as static files on GitHub Pages

Tested on 2026-10-31, because the maintainer doubted that SvelteKit hosts easily as static files. The same small app, a map, two named states and an OIDC toggle in the query string, was built on `@sveltejs/kit` 3.1.1 with `adapter-static` 4.0.1, and on plain Svelte 5.57.3 with Vite 8.3.5. A local server mimicked a Pages project site: plain files under a subpath, no rewrite rules, and `404.html` for anything else. Playwright 1.64.1 drove both in Chromium. This test did not run on real GitHub Pages. The application has since, as recorded in the next section.

| | SvelteKit | Plain Svelte on Vite |
|---|---|---|
| Output | One HTML file per state, `404.html`, and hashed JS and CSS | `index.html` and one JS file |
| Opening a named state by link | 200 | 404 |
| The same link with `?oidc=1` | Right diagram once JS has run | Blank page |
| Clicking from the map, toggling, the back button | Work | Work |
| Diagram in the raw HTML, and with JS off | Yes | No |
| Title and description per state | Yes | No |
| JS, each file gzipped and summed | 39 KB | 16 KB |
| Under `/pr-preview/pr-2/` | Works | Not tested |

Other points:

- **Kit 3 is new.** 3.0.0 was published on 2026-10-01. `svelte.config.js` is gone, `$lib` became `#lib`, and `$app/environment` became `$app/env`. The [docs](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapter-static) have a GitHub Pages section with a workflow.
- **Storybook 10.6.5 on Kit 3, through `@storybook/sveltekit`:** a plain component renders. A component importing `$app/state`, `$app/env` and `$app/paths` fails with `__SVELTEKIT_PAYLOAD__ is not defined`. Which import causes it was not isolated.
- **The query string is not available while prerendering.** A link with non-default settings shows the default state until JS runs. This flash was not measured.
- **Windows paths:** in a folder that made paths exceed 260 characters, Kit's config failed to load with `ERR_PACKAGE_IMPORT_NOT_DEFINED`. A shorter folder with `node-linker=hoisted` fixed it. Nothing suggests this is specific to Kit.
- **Previews on a sub page:** the `preview` input of `actions/deploy-pages` is marked alpha and not public. [pr-preview-action](https://github.com/rossjrw/pr-preview-action) (MIT, 448 stars, pushed 2026-10-27) deploys to a branch, so Pages has to deploy from that branch. Jekyll would then be expected to skip Kit's `_app` folder unless the site has a `.nojekyll` file. The next section records how this went.

## The application on real GitHub Pages

On 2026-10-31, when the repository went public and the first deploys ran, in pull requests 16 and 17. The click-through, 50 tests on Playwright 1.64.1 in Chromium, ran against the live addresses through `LIVE_URL`. The local server imitating Pages held up, apart from the differences listed here.

| | Result |
|---|---|
| Production | 50 of 50 |
| A preview, before production existed | 48 of 50. One test named the production path, which is now fixed. The other needs the site's own `404.html`, which did not exist yet |
| A preview, with production in place | 50 of 50 |
| A folder without its trailing slash | 301, as the local server does |
| From merge to live | 2 min 18 s: 1 min 29 s of checks, then 40 s of deploying, about 30 s of that waiting for Pages |

What the local server does not show:

- **A bad link in a preview gets production's error page.** Pages only looks for `404.html` at the site root, so a preview's own copy goes unused. The status is still 404.
- **Pages caches for ten minutes.** It sends `Cache-Control: max-age=600`, so a returning browser can show the old page for that long after a deploy.
- **`.nojekyll` outlives a preview.** The deploy action never deletes it, so closing pull request 16 left two empty files under `pr-preview/pr-16`, one from the site and one from the Storybook. The preview workflow now deletes them before deploying.
- **Pages turns itself on.** Creating a `gh-pages` branch on a public repository enabled Pages from that branch, and the API call to enable it then returned 409.

How far production and previews were shown to leave each other alone:

- Deploying a preview left production serving the same commit, with its files in place.
- A production redeploy with the preview of pull request 17 open ran `rsync --delete` with `pr-preview/` protected and found nothing to commit, and the preview's tree was unchanged. It had nothing to push, so a deploy that pushes while a preview is open has not been seen.
- No two pushes have collided yet, so the rebase that `force: false` asks for has not been exercised.

**Not exercised:** a commit failing CI on `main`. Deploy needs the checks and protection on `main` keeps such a commit out, so this rests on the job order.

## Showing RFCs inside the application

Checked on 2026-10-31, because the maintainer asked for an RFC to open in the application when it is just text.

- **Format:** every RFC has a plain text version on rfc-editor.org. RFC 9449 is 92 KB, RFC 6749 is 163 KB and RFC 6750 is 39 KB. The structured XML version only exists for newer RFCs, and RFC 6749 has none, so plain text is the one format they all share. Older ones keep their page headers and form feeds.
- **Licence:** [IETF Trust Legal Provisions 5.0](https://trustee.ietf.org/documents/trust-legal-provisions/tlp-5/), section 3.c, allows anyone "to copy, publish, display and distribute" them "in full and without modification". This is a reading of the text and not legal advice.
- **Loading:** rfc-editor.org sends `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, so a browser could fetch the text directly. The application copies the files instead ([ADR-009](../adr/009-code-is-apache-and-content-is-cc-by.md)).
- **Byte-order mark:** RFC 9449 starts with one, and browsers drop it when they decode a file. The file itself stays as published, and nothing visible changes.
- **Sections:** a heading starts at the left margin and the table of contents is indented, so the sections can be found without touching the text. RFC 6749 has appendices numbered `A.1`, and RFC pages on rfc-editor.org have an anchor like `#section-8`.
- **Other sources:** [OpenID Connect Core](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) is 427 KB of HTML whose notice allows reproduction for developing and implementing specifications. That does not obviously cover this, so it gets a summary and a link, as the Keycloak docs do.

## What a real Keycloak does

Recorded on 2026-11-01 with `pnpm record`, against `quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:26.8.1` in `start-dev`, with real logins through a headless browser. The answers are in `static/recordings/authorization-code/questions.json`, and each one came from a real request.

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Does Keycloak ask for a DPoP nonce? | No. A token request with a proof and no nonce got a 200 and a `DPoP` token, with no `DPoP-Nonce` header. So the retry is marked as from the spec only |
| Does a client need a setting to use DPoP? | No. A default client that sends a proof gets a bound token, and `dpop_jkt` on the authorization request is accepted |
| Does UserInfo take a DPoP-bound token? | Yes, as `Authorization: DPoP` with a proof tied to that token. Without the proof, or as `Bearer`, it answers 401 |
| Does API V1 take a DPoP-bound token? | Yes, as `Authorization: DPoP` with a proof. As `Bearer` it answers 400 `Invalid token`. **The prototype was wrong here** |
| Does API V2 take a DPoP-bound token? | No. It answers 400 `invalid_token` with a proof and without one. **The prototype offered this, so the application no longer does** |
| Does enabling API V2 turn V1 off? | Yes. V1 then answers 400 `Identity Brokering API feature not enabled`, which the docs do not say |
| What does each API version hand over? | V1 hands over everything stored, including the upstream's ID and refresh tokens. V2 hands over only the access token, with `expires_in` and `issued_token_type` |
| Is a public client without PKCE accepted? | Yes, by default. With `pkce.code.challenge.method` set to `S256` on the client, the app gets an error back at its redirect URI: `Missing parameter: code_challenge_method` |
| Is PKCE tied to the client type? | No. Keycloak applies it to any client that sends a challenge, and insists on it only when **Require PKCE** is on for the client, which is `pkce.code.challenge.method` in the admin API. So the two settings are independent |
| What can someone do with a code they intercepted? | On a public client without PKCE, get the tokens, and the real app then gets 400 `Code not valid`. With PKCE, nothing: no verifier gets 400 `PKCE code verifier not specified`, and a wrong one 400 `PKCE verification failed: Code mismatch`, with or without the secret. On a confidential client without PKCE, no secret gets 401 `unauthorized_client` |
| Does a refused try use up the code? | It depends where it was refused. When the PKCE check fails the code is gone, and the real app gets `Code not valid`, so someone with only the code can still spoil a login that PKCE protects. When client authentication fails the code survives, and the real app still got its tokens |
| What does a server say about the feature flags the settings name? | `dpop` and `identity-brokering-api:v1` are `DEFAULT` and on, and `identity-brokering-api:v2` is `DISABLED_BY_DEFAULT` and off, from `/admin/serverinfo`. The server does not call V1 deprecated, and the 26.8.1 docs do, so a badge says which is which. `pnpm record --check` fails when these change |
| What does a wrong redirect URI do? | 400 with `Invalid parameter: redirect_uri`, and no redirect |
| What does a wildcard in Valid redirect URIs let through? | `http://app/*` takes any path on that site, and refuses another site with a 400. `http://app*` also refuses an address that only starts the same. `*` alone takes any site at all |
| Do stolen tokens survive the real app trying the same code? | Keycloak cancels what the code got, as RFC 6749 section 4.1.2 advises: UserInfo goes from 200 to 401, and the refresh token gets 400 `invalid_grant`. An API that only checks the signature still answers 200, until the token expires |
| Is the implicit flow still there? | The discovery document lists `token` under `response_types_supported`, but a new client asking for it gets redirected with an error. With **Implicit flow** on, under Capability config, it gets the login page |
| What does Web origins do? | On a public client with the list empty, a token request from the page is blocked as a CORS error, and the same code still gets a 200 afterwards, so nothing was issued. With the app's origin listed, it gets a 200. A client created through the admin API with no list copies it from its redirect URIs, so this has to start from an empty one |
| Does Consent required change what is in the token? | Turned on afterwards, as someone does in the console, no: the token has the same audience and roles. Set when a client is created through the admin API, it also turns off Full scope allowed, and the token then has no roles and no audience. **The recorder did this until 2026-11-01, and nothing noticed, because the demo API did not check the audience** |

What changing a setting on a real server does, each one a real login before and after. These are what the Keycloak notes rest on, and the admin console was walked on the same version to see that each setting is where a note says.

| Setting, and where | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| **Valid redirect URIs**, Settings, Access settings | Address not listed: 400, `Invalid parameter: redirect_uri` | Listed: 200 and the login page |
| **Client authentication**, Settings, Capability config | On, no secret: 401 `unauthorized_client` | Off: 200 and tokens |
| **Require PKCE**, Settings, Capability config | Off, no challenge: a code | On: no code, and the error `Missing parameter: code_challenge_method` |
| **Require DPoP bound tokens**, Settings, Capability config | Off, no proof: 200 and a Bearer token | On: 400 `invalid_request` |
| Default **Client scopes** | `profile` and `email` on: the token has a name and an email address | Both off: neither, and `scope` is empty |
| **Audience** mapper, in the client's dedicated scope | `aud` is `account` | `aud` is `["my-api", "account"]` |
| **Access Token Lifespan**, Advanced, Advanced settings | `expires_in` 300 | Set to 60: `expires_in` 60 |
| **Store tokens**, on the identity provider | On: the app gets the token | Off: 400 `does not support this operation` |
| **Stored tokens readable**, on the identity provider | On: the app gets the token | Off, for a new user: 403 `not authorized to retrieve tokens` |
| **Allow retrieve external tokens**, Settings, Capability config, only with API V2 on | On: 200 | Off: 403 `Client not allowed to retrieve token for the provider` |
| A default provider on the **Identity Provider Redirector** | Set: 303 straight on to the other provider | Unset: 200 and Keycloak's own login page |

Reading the real console also corrected two things written from memory. The switch is called **Require PKCE**, because "PKCE Method" is only in the messages file, and **Require DPoP bound tokens** is under Capability config, not Advanced.

What else the recordings changed or showed:

- **The token response carries more than the diagram said:** `expires_in`, `refresh_token` and `scope` are there on a default client, so the diagram has them now. `refresh_expires_in`, `not-before-policy` and `session_state` are Keycloak's own, so the protocol layer leaves them out.
- **The redirects carry `iss`,** which the diagram left out. `session_state` is Keycloak's own again.
- **Who sees what holds.** Tokens never went through the browser in any named state, and the password only went to whichever server did the login. A test now holds every token chip to the recordings.
- **Keycloak adds hops the diagram does not draw:** `/broker/{alias}/login` before the redirect to the upstream, and `first-broker-login` and `after-first-broker-login` after a first brokered login. They are in the recordings with no step, because they say nothing about the protocol.
- **A default client's access token names `account` as its audience,** not the API it is going to be sent to. So an API that checks the audience refuses it until someone adds an Audience mapper, which a Keycloak note now says.
- **A brokered login sends the browser straight to the upstream only because the recorder sets that up,** with the identity provider redirector. By default, Keycloak shows its own login page with a button for the upstream. The diagram shows the first, because that is the case where the app really does not notice.

## What the content has and has not been checked against

- **Recorded on Keycloak 26.8.1:** every message the identity provider takes part in, in all eighteen named states, apart from the nonce retry.
- **From the demo app and API:** every message between the browser, the app and the API, in the same runs. They do the checks the steps say they do, in `scripts/record/checks.ts`, and a run stops if one fails, so a success in a recording means they looked. `theDemoChecks` in `questions.json` shows them refusing. That proves the check works once someone writes it, and says nothing about a server.
- **A stand-in:** the app that runs in the browser is recorded from a server. The messages are the same, and where they come from is not. A real call from a page is in `webOrigins`, for what the browser adds.
- **Read in RFC 9449, not seen on Keycloak:** the nonce retry with `use_dpop_nonce` and `DPoP-Nonce`. The nonce is the server's choice, so it is a setting and not part of DPoP itself, and the application marks these messages.
- **Not on the wire, so not recorded:** what people do in setup, which the recorder does through the admin API instead. So a note's "changed this" means through that API, and the console was only checked to have the label on that page.
- **General knowledge, not checked against anything here:** the "In practice" lines, about what a library usually does and what is left to your code. They say what is common, and no library is named.
- **Audited once, not held by a test:** the concept texts. A reader who had not seen the project compared them with the RFCs and the recordings on 2026-11-01, and the corrections are in pull requests 34 and 35. OpenID Connect Core is not in the repository, so what rests on it is from memory.

## The entry and the format

Looked at on 2026-10-31, because the maintainer named both as the references to follow.

- **roadmap.sh:** the home page has a search box, category chips and cards for 96 roadmaps. A roadmap is a node map on one long page, with a spine, branches, a legend, and progress marks on the nodes. It also carries accounts, ads and an AI tutor. Seen in screenshots of the home page and `/frontend`. What opening a node does was not confirmed.
- **IdentiFlows:** the home page has a search and a category filter over flow cards. A flow page has a description and tags, then the diagram, with five lifelines and 18 messages on code + PKCE, then links to specs. Interactive Mode adds Previous and Next, and the theme can be auto, light or dark. This check read the page text and DOM only, because the browser pane was hidden. The rendering itself was seen only in the earlier research.

## Keycloak feature flags

Sources: the [features page](https://www.keycloak.org/server/features) and [specifications page](https://www.keycloak.org/securing-apps/specifications). Neither states which version it describes. Their release switcher reads Nightly, 26.8.1, 26.7.5 and 26.6.4, and the admin guide's links carry 26.8.1.

| Flag | Description on the page | Status as stated |
|---|---|---|
| `cimd[:v1]` | None. Appears only in the option lists | No status on the features page. The specifications page lists "OAuth Client ID Metadata Document" as Experimental |
| `token-exchange-standard:v2` | Standard Token Exchange version 2 | Supported, enabled by default |
| `token-exchange:v1` | Token Exchange Service | Preview, disabled by default |
| `token-exchange-delegation:v1` | Token Exchange Delegation | Preview, disabled by default |
| `identity-brokering-api:v1` | Identity Brokering API V1 | Supported, enabled by default |
| `identity-brokering-api:v2` | Identity Brokering API V2 | Supported, disabled by default |
| `twitter-broker:v1` | Twitter Identity Broker | Supported, enabled by default |
| `instagram-broker:v1` | Instagram Identity Broker | Deprecated, disabled by default |
| `client-auth-federated:v1` | Authenticates client based on assertions issued by identity provider | Supported, enabled by default |
| `jwt-authorization-grant:v1` | JWT Profile for OAuth 2.0 Authorization Grant | Supported, enabled by default |
| `kubernetes-service-accounts:v1` | Kubernetes service accounts trust relationship provider | Supported, enabled by default |
| `spiffe:v1` | SPIFFE trust relationship provider | Preview |

Other points:

- **Core identity brokering is not listed as a flag.** Neither page says whether it needs one, and the brokering docs mention none.
- **Token exchange direction:** the specifications page says "Token exchange V2 only supports the internal to internal use-case", so RFC 8693 support is partial. Neither page says which feature enables external-to-internal or internal-to-external exchange.
- **Names listed with no description or status:** `client-auth-abca`, `identity-assertion-jwt`, `ipa-tuura-federation`. The page does not say whether these relate.
- **Not read:** the [token exchange guide](https://www.keycloak.org/securing-apps/token-exchange), the [MCP authorization server page](https://www.keycloak.org/securing-apps/mcp-authz-server) and the [chaining page](https://www.keycloak.org/securing-apps/oauth-identity-authorization-chaining-across-domains). Read these before writing content on those topics.

Release notes found by search add that [Keycloak 26.6.0](https://www.keycloak.org/2026/04/keycloak-2660-released) added experimental CIMD so Keycloak can act as an authorization server for MCP, and promoted federated client authentication and JWT Authorization Grant to supported. This comes from a search summary and was not read in full.

## User federation vs identity brokering

Source: the [Server Administration Guide](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html). "User Federation" is the admin console's menu label, and the guide's section is called "Using external storage". Brokering is under "Integrating identity providers".

- **User federation:** user records stay in existing external stores. Keycloak supports LDAP and Active Directory, and the User Storage SPI allows custom databases. At login Keycloak searches that storage and maps the record into its own user model. The intro describes a server-side lookup and does not mention sending the browser elsewhere.
- **Identity brokering:** the guide describes an intermediary connecting service providers with identity providers, typically over SAML 2.0, OpenID Connect or OAuth 2.0. Its overview says Keycloak redirects the user to the identity provider's login page. Accounts can be linked to external identities or created from them. Client applications never contact the external provider.

## Is application setup explained visually anywhere?

One search for visual explainers of client registration from the application's point of view found only text: a [MojoAuth glossary](https://mojoauth.com/glossary/client-id), [Thales setup docs](https://thalesdocs.com/oip/idaas-core/idaas-core-tulip/oauth-openid/oauth-oidc-setup/index.html), the [OpenID Connect registration spec](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0-12.html) and vendor docs. **This supports the maintainer's point but is a weak test.** It would not catch vendor quickstarts with diagrams, which are the most likely counterexamples, or a setup section inside a course. Note that IdentiFlows does have an OIDC Discovery flow, so part of this is covered as a separate flow.

## Are external IdPs explained interactively anywhere?

One search found no interactive explainer. The closest material is [Authlete's tutorial on integration with external IdPs](https://www.authlete.com/developers/tutorial/idp), which has a federation flow illustration, and [Red Hat's identity broker docs](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/vi-vn/red_hat_single_sign-on/7.4/html/server_administration_guide/identity_broker). The earlier research also found one `identity_broker_flow` figure in Keycloak's guide. **Also a weak test.**

## Confirming the headline tools

Separate searches confirmed the two closest tools and what they are for:

- **IdentiFlows:** [Auth0's announcement](https://auth0.com/blog/introducing-identiflows-a-visual-reference-for-identity-flows/) describes per-flow pages with an intro, a sequence diagram and a step-by-step breakdown. It calls this an early release and asks for feedback. An earlier copy of the post said Client Credentials, Device Authorization and WebAuthn were coming soon. The first two have since shipped, so WebAuthn may be next.
- **AuthPlayground:** [Ping's docs](https://developer.pingidentity.com/identity-for-ai/protocols/authplayground-cimd.html) confirm it is a simulated environment with no external IdP. Ping also describes a "Full Cross-Domain Access" flow that chains PAR, RAR, PKCE, DPoP and token exchange across seven steps. **That is the nearest thing to composition found**, but it is a fixed chain the reader cannot change.

## What a stolen code gets with DPoP, and other corrections

Tried on Keycloak 26.8.1 on 2026-11-01, because a claims audit doubted what the screen said. The answers are in `questions.json`, and a test holds the words to them.

- **Public client, no PKCE, a login that named the key with `dpop_jkt`:** no proof gets a 400 "DPoP Proof missing", another key's proof a 400 "DPoP Proof public key thumbprint does not match dpop_jkt", and the right key a 200. So "whoever intercepted the code gets the tokens" was false here.
- **The same, with no `dpop_jkt`:** no proof gets a 200 and a Bearer token, and the thief's own key a 200 and a DPoP token.
- **The same, with Require DPoP bound tokens on:** no proof gets a 400, and the thief's own key still gets a 200. So that setting alone does not protect a code.
- **Consent required on a public client:** remembered just as on a confidential one. Asked again only for a new scope, listing only that scope, and then not again.
- **Require PKCE on a client with a secret:** a login with no challenge gets no code, with "Missing parameter: code_challenge_method".
- **A default client's audience:** without the default `roles` client scope the access token has no `aud` at all, so `account` comes from that scope and not from an Audience mapper.
- **API V2, what has to be on for the app to get the stored token:** neither Store tokens nor Store token in session gets a 400, and either one or both gets a 200.
- **`kc_idp_hint`:** with no default provider set on the Identity Provider Redirector, this still goes straight to the other provider.

What libraries do was read at their source the same day, and the claims and links are in `src/lib/flow/libraries.ts` and on the steps. Worth knowing: passport-oauth2 only compares `state` with `state: true`, and throws if PKCE is on without it. Auth.js has PKCE on by default and checks `state` only when configured to. Spring Security compares `state` unasked. oauth4webapi leaves the ID token's signature to a separate call, because OIDC Core allows skipping it for a token that came straight over TLS. AWS API Gateway's JWT authorizer lists no proof among what it checks, so a DPoP token sent as Bearer would pass its checks.
