	},

		label: 'code',
		short: 'code',
		explains:
			'A one-time ticket. It travels through the browser, where it can be seen, so on its own it should be worth little, which takes a secret or PKCE. The app trades it for tokens on a direct call.'

		label: 'client secret',
		short: 'secret',
		explains:
			'Like a password, but for the app. It is agreed during setup, and shows that this really is the registered app when it trades a code for tokens. An app running on someone else’s device cannot keep one.'
	},
	verifier: {
		label: 'code verifier',
		short: 'verifier',
		explains:
			'A random value the app makes up for this one login and keeps to itself. It is sent once, directly, when the app trades the code, and never in a redirect. So someone who saw the code still does not have it.'
	},
	challenge: {
		label: 'code challenge',
		short: 'challenge',
		explains:
			'A fingerprint of the verifier. It can be worked out from the verifier but not the other way round, so it is safe to send through the browser. The identity provider keeps it with the code, and compares it with the verifier later.'

		label: 'access token',

		explains:
			'What the app shows an API to be let in. It stands for the access that was granted. It is meant for the API to read, and the app should just carry it.'

	'id-token': {
		label: 'ID token',
		short: 'ID',
		explains:
			'Tells the app who logged in, when and where. Unlike the access token, it is made for the app to read, after checking it. It does not get you into an API.'

		label: 'refresh token',
		short: 'refresh',
		explains:
			'Gets the app a new access token later, without the user having to log in again. It only ever goes to the identity provider, and it lasts longer than an access token, so it is worth more to a thief.'
	},
	session: {
		label: 'session',
		short: 'session',
		explains:
			'How the identity provider remembers this browser. It is a cookie on the address of the identity provider, so the browser sends it there and nowhere else, and no app ever sees it. It is why a second app does not ask for a password. An app usually keeps a session of its own as well, which is a different thing.'
	},
	proof: {
		label: 'key proof',
		short: 'proof',
		explains:
			'A short signed note showing that the sender holds a private key, which an API that checks it will ask a stolen token for. A new one goes with each request, tied to its method and address and good for a short time. A server that remembers those it has seen can refuse a repeat, and not all do.'
	},
	'upstream-token': {
		label: 'upstream token',
		short: 'upstream',
		explains:
			'A token the other provider issued, for calling that provider’s own APIs. It is not the token the app got from its own identity provider.'
